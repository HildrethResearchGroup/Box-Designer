/**
 This class provides an abstract-like class for the allowed cutout shapes. This set up enables the types of cutout shapes to be easily extended in the future. Note: although it's usually better to use protocols as a substitute for abstract classes in Swift, protocols cannot conform to Codable. Therefore, this class was used.
