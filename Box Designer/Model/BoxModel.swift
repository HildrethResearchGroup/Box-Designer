        - currentWall: This is the wall that was already in the box model and would be intersected by the new wall without dimension adjustment.
        - addedWall: This is the new wall that is being added to the box model and must adjust its dimensions according to the wall it would intersect.
     - Note: There is probably a better, more dynamic way to deal with wall intersection. However, SCNHitTestResult does not find the intersecting between two nodes, unless they are SCNPhysicsBody objects (and I'm not sure that would work, as our nodes don't have an associated physicsBody property). I also tried to use the hit test between a segment (vector) and a node, but I was never able to get a result from a hit test, even when I knew two walls were going to intersect. There's probably a way to do it, but we ran out of time.
