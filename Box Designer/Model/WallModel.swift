        - wallNumber: this is the unique ID of the wall, determined by BoxModel.wallNumberStatic

        - materialThickness: this is the wall's material thickness
        - wallType: this is the type of wall (largeCorner, longCorner, or smallCorner)
        - joinType: this is the join type between walls
        - position: this is where the path of the wall starts
        - numberTabs: this is the number of tabs for the wall
